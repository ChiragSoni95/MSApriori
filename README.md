# MSApriori
MSApriori algorithm is capable of classifying rare classes. The performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm has been done for different data sets  and in comparison with existing technique like Apriori algorithm it is found that algorithm has efficient and superior performance for classifying rare cases. 
Additional Parameters:

Must Have : Item IDs which must be present in any given itemset
Cannot Be Together : Item IDs which cannot be together in the same itemset
Support Difference Constraint : Difference between max(MIS(i)) and min(MIS(i)) cannot be larger than a constant 'phi'
